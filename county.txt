COUNTY RESOURCES

ATLANTA METRO COUNTY RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES
You shouldn't have to Google "where do I get help" at 2am. Here's everything in one place. These are the county-level resources available to families in the Greater Atlanta area.

We Know This List is Overwhelming
Here's the truth: Most families look at this list and feel exhausted before they even start calling. You're already managing your child's care, appointments, medications, and everything else—now you're supposed to navigate a maze of county offices?

That's where we come in. When you work with B'Nore Care, we help you connect with these resources. We know which offices actually answer their phones, which forms you need, and how to get things approved faster.

You don't have to do this alone. Call us at (770) 674-6448 and we'll walk you through it.
