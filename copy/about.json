      "I'll never forget the phone call. A mother, voice shaking, telling me her medically fragile daughter had been through five different nursing agencies in six months. 'They're all qualified,' she said, 'but nobody sees my daughter. They just see her diagnosis.'",
      "That conversation changed everything for me. I'd spent years working in pediatric nursing, and I'd seen this pattern over and over—families desperate not just for skilled care, but for someone who would truly see their child. Someone who would learn that Emma loves Taylor Swift, that Marcus laughs at dad jokes, that Sophia needs her stuffed elephant before every breathing treatment.",
      "B'Nore Care exists because your child is not a diagnosis. They're a whole person with dreams, preferences, fears, and an incredible capacity for joy—even when their bodies don't cooperate. Our nurses don't just manage trachs and vents; they become part of your child's world, celebrating the victories (even the tiny ones) and holding space for the hard days.",
