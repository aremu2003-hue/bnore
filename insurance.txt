INSURANCE & PAYMENT OPTIONS

WE'LL HELP YOU NAVIGATE THE INSURANCE MAZE
Insurance paperwork is confusing, frustrating, and sometimes feels designed to make you give up. We won't let that happen. We'll help you get the coverage your child deserves.

Let's Be Honest About Insurance
Dealing with insurance for pediatric home health care is a nightmare. There, we said it. The denials, the prior authorizations, the endless phone calls, the forms that ask the same questions seventeen different ways—it's exhausting.

You're already managing your child's medical needs, coordinating specialist appointments, fighting with the school district, and trying to keep your family functioning. The last thing you need is to become an expert in insurance billing codes.

That's where we come in. We've been doing this for years, and we know how to get approvals, fight denials, and navigate the system. You shouldn't have to do this alone.

How We Help You Navigate Insurance
1
We Check Your Eligibility
Not sure if your child qualifies? We'll review your situation and let you know which programs you're eligible for. No guessing, no wasted applications.

2
We Complete the Applications
Those 47-page application forms? We'll help you fill them out correctly the first time. We know exactly what documentation is needed and how to present your child's needs in a way that gets approved.

3
We Fight Denials
Got denied? Don't panic. We know how to appeal, what documentation to submit, and how to get decisions overturned. We've done this hundreds of times.

4
We Handle All Billing
You'll never see a bill from us. We bill insurance directly, handle all the paperwork, and deal with any billing issues. Your job is to focus on your child—not on medical bills.

5
We Keep Your Coverage Active
Renewals, recertifications, updated care plans—we track all the deadlines and make sure your coverage doesn't lapse. You have enough to remember without adding insurance renewal dates to the list.

Common Insurance Questions
"What if my child doesn't qualify for GAPP, Medicare, or Medicaid?"
Let's talk. There are other programs and options we can explore. We'll help you find a way to get your child the care they need, even if it means connecting you with other resources or agencies.

"How long does the approval process take?"
It varies, but typically 2-6 weeks for initial applications. If your child needs care urgently, let us know—we can sometimes expedite the process or arrange temporary coverage while we wait for approval.

"What if I've been denied before?"
Denials happen all the time—often because the application wasn't filled out correctly or didn't include the right documentation. Let us review your case. We might be able to appeal the denial or reapply with better supporting information.

"Will I really have zero out-of-pocket costs?"
For qualified families with GAPP, Medicare, or Medicaid coverage—yes, absolutely zero. We bill insurance directly, and you won't receive any bills from us. If there are any coverage issues, we'll work them out with the insurance company, not with you.
