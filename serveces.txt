GREATER ATLANTA PEDIATRIC HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES

SKILLED CARE DELIVERED WITH COMPASSION
Every service we provide comes with something you can't find on a clinical checklist: genuine care for your child as a whole person, not just a set of medical needs.

Here's What You Need to Know
We could list every clinical procedure we're qualified to perform. We could use impressive medical terminology and talk about our certifications. And yes, all of that matters—you need to know we're competent.

But here's what matters more: We understand that behind every "service" is a child who might be scared, a parent who's exhausted, and a family that's been through more than most people can imagine.

So when we talk about "tracheostomy care," we're also talking about the nurse who notices your son gets anxious before suctioning and learns to warn him first. When we say "medication administration," we mean the nurse who remembers that your daughter's seizure med works better with applesauce, not pudding.

The technical skills are the baseline. The compassion, attention to detail, and genuine care? That's what makes us B'Nore Care.

Personal Care & Daily Living Support
Because dignity matters in every moment

Bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding—these aren't just tasks on a checklist. They're intimate moments that require patience, gentleness, and respect for your child's comfort and dignity. Our nurses understand that how we do these things matters just as much as getting them done.

Real Talk:

We know you've probably had aides who rush through bath time or don't notice that your daughter hates having her hair washed a certain way. Our nurses take the time to learn your child's preferences and honor them.

Mobility & Positioning Assistance
Safe movement with comfort and care

Safe transfers, comfortable positioning, and movement support that respects your child's body and comfort level. We know that improper positioning can lead to pain, pressure sores, and contractures—and we're meticulous about getting it right.

Real Talk:

If your child has specific positioning needs or gets anxious during transfers, we'll work with you to develop techniques that feel safe for everyone. No one should dread being moved.

Medication Administration
The right med, right dose, right time—every time

Timely, accurate medication management by nurses who understand your child's complete care plan. We don't just follow a chart—we know the 'why' behind every dose, watch for interactions, and communicate with your medical team.

Real Talk:

We've all heard the horror stories about medication errors. We use multiple verification systems and never, ever rush. Your child's safety is non-negotiable.

Tracheostomy Care
Expert trach care with calm confidence

Expert trach care and suctioning from nurses who've done this hundreds of times—but who also remember how terrifying it was the first time they did it. We'll teach you, support you, and be there when you need backup.

Real Talk:

That moment when the trach needs changing and you're home alone? We get it. We're available 24/7, and we'll talk you through it or come to you if needed. You're not alone in this.

Ventilator & Respiratory Support
Breathing easier, together

Ventilator management, oxygen therapy, chest physiotherapy, and breathing treatments delivered with skill and calm. We monitor closely, respond quickly to changes, and keep your child comfortable.

Real Talk:

Alarms going off in the middle of the night are exhausting. Our nurses handle vent checks and troubleshooting so you can actually sleep—something you probably haven't done well in months.

G-Tube & Feeding Support
Nourishment with patience and care

G-tube care, feeding administration, and nutritional monitoring. We handle tube placements, feeding schedules, and work with your dietitian to ensure your child gets the nutrition they need.

Real Talk:

Feeding issues are stressful. Whether it's reflux, retching, or equipment problems, we've seen it all and we know how to troubleshoot. Plus, we'll clean up without making you feel bad about the mess.

Wound Care & Ostomy Management
Healing with expertise and gentleness

Pressure wound care, surgical site care, and ostomy management. We use evidence-based techniques to promote healing while minimizing discomfort.

Real Talk:

Wound care can be painful, and we know your child might be scared or resistant. We go slow, we explain what we're doing, and we never force anything. Trust is earned, not demanded.

Seizure Management & Monitoring
Vigilant care during vulnerable moments

Seizure monitoring, emergency medication administration, and recovery support. We're trained to recognize seizure activity, respond appropriately, and keep your child safe.

Real Talk:

Watching your child have a seizure never gets easier. Our nurses stay calm, follow your seizure action plan, and document everything so you have accurate information for the neurologist.

Skilled Nursing Assessments
Clinical expertise with a caring heart

Ongoing health monitoring, vital signs, symptom management, and communication with your child's medical team. We catch small changes before they become big problems.

Real Talk:

You know that gut feeling when something's 'off' but you can't quite explain it? We trust that instinct. If you're worried, we're worried—and we'll investigate.

Family Training & Support
Empowering you with knowledge and confidence

We don't just care for your child—we teach you techniques, answer your questions (no matter how small), and build your confidence to handle care when we're not there.

Real Talk:

There's no such thing as a stupid question. Ask us a hundred times how to do something—we'll show you a hundred and one times. Your child's safety depends on you feeling confident, and we're here to make that happen.

What We Don't Do
We believe in transparency, so let's be clear about our limitations:

We don't do "one size fits all" care plans. Every child is different, and cookie-cutter approaches don't work. We customize everything to your child's needs.

We don't send whoever's available. We match nurses to families based on personality, experience, and compatibility—not just who has an open schedule.

We don't make promises we can't keep. If we're not the right fit for your needs, we'll tell you and help you find someone who is.

We don't ignore your concerns. If something's not working, speak up. We'll listen and make changes. Your feedback makes us better.

Let's Talk About What Your Child Needs
Every child's care plan is unique. Let's have a conversation about your specific situation—no pressure, no sales pitch. Just honest answers to your questions.
